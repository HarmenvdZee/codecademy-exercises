        <h2>Which styling rule is applied when multiple rules collide</h2>
        <p>
          On this page we will discuss how the browser determines which styling to
          apply when their are multiple styling rules acting on the same element
          and property of that element.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is mainly done by looking at the which selector is used for the
          styling rules of that element. Based on the selectors the browser
          creates an order of importance for the styling rules.
          <br />
          <br />
          The order of importance for these selectors will be covered in the
          following table
        </p>
  
        <div class="tableOfImportance">
          <h3>Table of selector importance</h3>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Selector</th>
                <th>HTML</th>
                <th>CSS</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>ID</td>
                <td>id='IDselector'</td>
                <td>#IDselector {}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>class</td>
                <td>class='classSelector'</td>
                <td>.classSelector {}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>type</td>
                <td>&lttype&gt &lt/type&gt</td>
                <td>type {}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>no value</td>
                <td class="'italic">all elements</td>
                <td>* {}</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
  
        <p>
          So for example if an elements font size is determined by both a styling
          rule that uses its type and a styling rule that uses its ID. Then it
          will take the font size of the rule that uses the ID.
